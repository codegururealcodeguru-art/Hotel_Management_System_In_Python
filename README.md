introduction
The Hotel Management System is a simple, interactive GUI-based desktop application developed using Python’s Tkinter library. This system is designed to assist in managing guest check-ins and check-outs in a hotel. It offers a user-friendly interface where hotel staff can easily enter guest information, assign room types, view a list of currently checked-in guests, and perform check-outs as needed.

This project is an ideal demonstration of how graphical user interfaces can be used to simplify basic hotel operations without the need for complex databases or web applications. It focuses on the fundamental functionality required in hotel guest management while maintaining a clean and intuitive design.

Key Objectives
Collect guest details like name, phone number, and room type

Maintain a temporary list of all checked-in guests

Allow real-time check-in and check-out

Display a summary of all current guests using a text output area

Use message boxes for interaction and feedback

Technologies Used
Python 3

Tkinter (standard GUI toolkit)

Built-in data structures (like lists and dictionaries)

Why This Project?
Demonstrates GUI application development in Python

Encourages good programming practices like OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Serves as a foundation for future enhancements like database integration, reporting, and payment processing
